The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most introductory courses.  At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning.  Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.</p><section data-depth="2" id="eip-887"><h2 class="title">Coverage and Scope</h2><p class="para" id="eip-617">To develop <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em>, we acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor&#8217;s second edition of Principles of Economics and solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to Ph.D.-granting universities.  They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet the needs of both instructors and students. </p><p class="para" id="eip-id1169327261430">The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. And to make it more applied, we have incorporated many current topics.  We hope students will be interested to know just how far-reaching the recent recession was (and still is), for example, and why there is so much controversy even among economists over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The Keystone Pipeline, Occupy Wall Street, minimum wage debates, and the appointment of the United States&#8217; first female Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, are just a few of the other important topics covered. 

</p><p class="para" id="eip-id1169368893095">The pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary.  The outcome is a balanced approach to micro and macro economics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. Current events are treated in a politically-balanced way as well.  

</p><p class="para" id="eip-734">The book is organized into eight main parts:</p><ul class="list" id="eip-679"><li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">What is Economics?</strong>  The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Supply and Demand</strong>, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.</li>

<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory</strong>, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Microeconomic Policy Issues</strong>, Chapters 11 through 18, cover the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities.  Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public choice.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals</strong>, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis</strong>, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the Aggregate Demand-Aggregate Supply Model.  The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives.  The income-Expenditure model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Monetary and Fiscal Policy</strong>, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation.  Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.</li>

<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">International Economics</strong>, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.

Throughout the OpenStax version of <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em>, you will find new features that engage the students in economic inquiry by taking selected topics a step further. Our features include:
</p><ul class="list" id="eip-213"><li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Bring it Home:</strong> This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter&#8217;s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts:  the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro module) and the second at chapter&#8217;s end, when students have learned what&#8217;s necessary to understand the case and &#8220;bring home&#8221; the chapter&#8217;s core concepts.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Work it Out:</strong> This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived. </li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Clear it Up:</strong> This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor&#8217;s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear it Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CiU starts with a question.  The rest of the feature explains the answer.</li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Link It Up:</strong> This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students&#8217; understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-651"><h2 class="title">Questions for Each Level of Learning</h2><p class="para" id="eip-454">
The OpenStax version of <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">Principles of Economics</em> further expands on Taylor&#8217;s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end-of-module questions for students.  
</p><ul class="list" id="eip-284"><li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Self-Checks:</strong> Are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They &#8220;click&#8211;to-reveal&#8221; an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think a bit beyond what is said in the text.  Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.  </li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Review Questions:</strong> Have been retained from Taylor&#8217;s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (<u class="emphasis" data-effect="underline">not</u> multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text. </li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Critical Thinking Questions:</strong> Are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">demonstrate their understanding by applying</em> what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">reasoning</em> about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn&#8217;t have thought of going themselves.  </li>
<li class="item"><strong class="emphasis">Problems:</strong> Are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module. </li></ul></section><section data-depth="2" id="eip-780"><h2 class="title">Updated Art</h2><p class="para" id="eip-26">

more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour.
Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse&#8212;as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm; http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu)
