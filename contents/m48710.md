When news reports indicate that “the economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter,” the reports are referring to the percentage change in real GDP. By convention, GDP growth is reported at an annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, it is multiplied by four when it is reported as if the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.

 ![The graph illustrates that both real GDP and real GDP per capita have substantially increased since 1900.](../resources/CNX_Econ_C19_008.jpg "Real GDP in the United States in 2012 was about $13 trillion. After adjusting to remove the effects of inflation, this represents a roughly 20-fold increase in the economy&#x2019;s production of goods and services since the start of the twentieth century.

[\[link\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_008) shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900. The generally upward long-term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short-term declines. A significant decline in real GDP is called a **recession**{: data-type="term"}. An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a **depression**{: data-type="term"}. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the **Great Depression**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure, as is the **Great Recession**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis} of 2008–2009.

Real GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.

The most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of the workers they have. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best—or they may even be asked to take pay cuts.

[\[link\]](#Table_19_09) lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. The highest point of the economy, before the recession begins, is called the **peak**{: data-type="term"}; conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before a recovery begins, is called the **trough**{: data-type="term"}. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak. The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the **business cycle**{: data-type="term"}. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960. The most recent recession started in December 2007 and ended formally in June 2009. This was the most severe recession since the Great Depression of the 1930’s.

A private think tank, the **National Bureau of Economic Research**{: data-type="term" .no-emphasis}, is the official tracker of business cycles for the U.S. economy. However, the effects of a severe recession often linger on after the official ending date assigned by the NBER.

# Key Concepts and Summary

Over the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the same amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle. When GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions begin at the peak of the business cycle and end at the trough.

# Self-Check Questions

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Without looking at [[link]](#Table_19_09), return to [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C19_008). If a recession is defined as a significant decline in national output, can you identify any post-1960 recessions in addition to the recession of 2008–2009? (This requires a judgment call.)

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
Two other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips: those of 1973–1975, and 1981–1982. Two other recessions appear in the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in 1990–1991 and 2001.

</div>
</div>

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
According to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how often have recessions occurred since the end of World War II (1945)?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession every six years.

</div>
</div>

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
According to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how long has the average recession lasted since the end of World War II?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The table lists the “Months of Contraction” for each recession. Averaging these figures for the post-WWII recessions gives an average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.

</div>
</div>

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
According to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how long has the average expansion lasted since the end of World War II?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
The table lists the “Months of Expansion.” Averaging these figures for the post-WWII expansions gives an average expansion of 60.5 months, or more than five years.

# Review Question

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
What are the typical patterns of GDP for a high-income economy like the United States in the long run and the short run?

</div>
</div>

# Critical Thinking Questions

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Why do you suppose that U.S. GDP is so much higher today than 50 or 100 years ago?

</div>
</div>

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Why do you think that GDP does not grow at a steady rate, but rather speeds up and slows down?
